# 🧱 LEGO Data Analysis Project

This project explores the history and evolution of LEGO sets, themes, and colors from 1949 to 2020 using Python, PostgreSQL, and data visualization. As a student learning and experimenting with coding and data analysis, I created this project to practice working with real datasets and improve my skills in data wrangling, querying, and visualization. This project was build with Udemy App Brewery Bootcamp Course

## 📚 About the Project

Using three official LEGO datasets, I answer key questions such as:

- How many unique LEGO colors exist?
- Which colors are transparent vs. opaque?
- What are the largest LEGO sets by part count?
- How did the number of sets and themes grow over the decades?
- Which theme has the most sets?
- How has the average number of parts per set changed over time?

## 🗃️ Datasets Used

- `colors.csv` – All LEGO colors and transparency info  
- `sets.csv` – LEGO set metadata including release year, theme, and part count  
- `themes.csv` – List of all LEGO themes and IDs

---

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `Jupyter Notebook`
- **PostgreSQL** – For querying and relational analysis
- **Google Colab** – For development and exploration
- **GitHub** – To document and share my learning journey

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- Line plots of sets and themes over time  
- Dual-axis comparison of set and theme growth  
- Scatter plot of average parts per set  
- Bar chart of top 10 themes by number of sets

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm a student currently learning Python, SQL, and data analysis. This project is part of my learning journey, and I’m sharing it in case it helps or inspires others starting out with data exploration and storytelling.

## 🚧 Still a Work in Progress

As I continue learning, I plan to:

- Add more advanced SQL queries  
- Integrate seaborn for styled plots  
- Improve markdown documentation  
- Explore correlations between themes, parts, and popularity
